  "familyFormicidaeDescription": "Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from vespoid wasp ancestors in the Cretaceous period. More than 13,800 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their geniculate (elbowed) antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.",
  "familyAmpulicidaeTitle": "Ampulicidae",
  "familyAmpulicidaeDescription": "Ampulicidae, or cockroach wasps, are a small (about 170 species), primarily tropical family of sphecoid wasps, all of which use various cockroaches as prey for their larvae. They are the most primitive family of sphecoid hunting wasps. They tend to have elongated jaws, pronounced neck-like constrictions behind the head, strongly petiolate abdomens, and deep grooves on the thorax. Many are quite ant-like in appearance, though some are brilliant metallic blue, green, and hot pink.",
  "familyCoreidaeTitle": "Coreidae",
  "familyCoreidaeDescription": "Coreidae is a large family of predominantly sap-sucking insects in the Hemipteran suborder Heteroptera. The name \"Coreidae\" derives from the genus Coreus, which derives from the Ancient Greek κόρις (kóris) meaning bedbug. As a family, the Coreidae are cosmopolitan, but most of the species are tropical or subtropical.",
  "familyCorinnidaeTitle": "Corinnidae",
  "familyCorinnidaeDescription": "Corinnidae is a family of araneomorph spiders, sometimes called corinnid sac spiders. The family, like other \"clubionoid\" families, has a confusing taxonomic history. Once it was a part of the large catch-all taxon Clubionidae, now very much smaller. The original members of the family are apparently similar only in that they have eight eyes arranged in two rows, conical anterior spinnerets that touch and are generally wandering predators that build silken retreats, or sacs, usually on plant terminals, between leaves, under bark or under rocks.",
  "familyMutillidaeTitle": "mutillidae",
  "familyMutillidaeDescription": "The Mutillidae are a family of more than 7,000 species of wasps whose wingless females resemble large, hairy ants. Their common name velvet ant refers to their resemblance to an ant, and their dense pile of hair, which most often is bright scarlet or orange, but may also be black, white, silver, or gold. Their bright colors serve as aposematic signals. They are known for their extremely painful stings, (the sting of the species Dasymutilla klugii rated a 3 on the Schmidt pain index and lasts up to 30 minutes), and has resulted in the common name \"cow killer\" or \"cow ant\" being applied to the species Dasymutilla occidentalis. However, mutillids are not aggressive and sting only in defense. In addition, the actual toxicity of their venom is much lower than that of honey bees or harvester ants. Unlike true ants, they are solitary, and lack complex social systems.",
  "familySalticidaeTitle": "Salticidae",
  "familySalticidaeDescription": "Jumping spiders are a group of spiders that constitute the family Salticidae. As of 2019, this family contained over 600 described genera and over 6,000 described species, making it the largest family of spiders at 13% of all species. Jumping spiders have some of the best vision among arthropods and use it in courtship, hunting, and navigation. Although they normally move unobtrusively and fairly slowly, most species are capable of very agile jumps, notably when hunting, but sometimes in response to sudden threats or crossing long gaps. Both their book lungs and tracheal system are well-developed, and they use both systems (bimodal breathing). Jumping spiders are generally recognized by their eye pattern. All jumping spiders have four pairs of eyes, with the anterior median pair being particularly large.",
  "familyThomisidaeTitle": "Thomisidae",
  "familyThomisidaeDescription": "The Thomisidae are a family of spiders, including about 170 genera and over 2,100 species. The common name crab spider is often linked to species in this family, but is also applied loosely to many other families of spiders. Many members of this family are also known as flower spiders or flower crab spiders.",
  "familyReduviidaeTitle": "Reduviidae",
  "familyReduviidaeDescription": "The Reduviidae is a large cosmopolitan family of the suborder Heteroptera of the order Hemiptera (true bugs). Among the Hemiptera and together with the Nabidae almost all species are terrestrial ambush predators; most other predatory Hemiptera are aquatic. The main examples of non-predatory Reduviidae are some blood-sucking ectoparasites in the subfamily Triatominae, with a few species from South America noted for their ability to transmit Chagas disease.",

  "subFamilyHarpactorinaeTitle": "Harpactorinae",
  "subFamilyHarpactorinaeDescription": "Harpactorinae is a subfamily of ants within the Reduviidae family, primarily known for their predatory behavior. They are characterized by their robust body structure and aggressive hunting strategies. They are often found in tropical regions and are part of the broader group of assassin bugs.",
  "subFamilyMyrmeciinaeTitle": "Myrmeciinae",
  "subFamilyMyrmeciinaeDescription": "Myrmeciinae is a subfamily of ants known as the 'myrmecine ants,' which includes the genus Myrmecia. They are distinguished by their large size, powerful mandibles, and aggressive behavior. They are primarily found in Australia and are known for their solitary foraging habits.",
  "subFamilyMyrmicinaeTitle": "Myrmicinae",
  "subFamilyMyrmicinaeDescription": "Myrmicinae is a diverse and widespread subfamily of ants that includes genera such as Myrmica, Solenopsis, and Tetramorium. They are known for their varied ecological roles, including scavenging, predation, and mutualistic relationships with other organisms.",
